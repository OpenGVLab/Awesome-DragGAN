DragGAN has been one of the most popular generative image editing model these days. It provide a brand new way to edit the image by interatively selecting target and source points on the image, giving the greater flexibility to users than existing text-based editing. Though constrainted to generative image manifold currently, the idea of DragGAN should inspired and have inspired a varity of following works.
